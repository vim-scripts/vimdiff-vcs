Full-blown support for CVS diffing.  Like vimscript #1209 (and unlike vimscript #90 ), this is a command-line program that merely figures out what to compare a file against.  Unlike both, this is a drop-in replacement that doesn't require getting used to a new command with different syntax.  it just works.

In addition to all vim flags, vimdiff+vcs supports the CVS revision denoting flags (-r, -D).  vimdiff+vcs also supports filesystem snapshots (e.g. those from a NetApp mountpoint), automatically parsing through the archives and comparing the specified file to the most recent version that differs.

The key useful feature here is that it's fully automatic; you just type "gvimdiff mycode.c" and it pops up the differences between mycode.c and the latest other copy available, be it the CVS HEAD or a more recent version from your snapshots.

If I ever do start using subversion with more regularity, this script will support that too.  It's even named "vimdiff+vcs" rather than "vimdiff+cvs" in anticipation of that (well, also for the .snapshot support).
